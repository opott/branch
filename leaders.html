      <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
      <p>
        It is advised that your members have already completed
        <a href="https://boba.hackclub.com/" class="link" target="_blank"
          >Boba Drops</a
        >
        or another
        <a href="https://webdev.hackclub.com/" class="link" target="_blank"
          >Web Dev YSWS</a
        >, depending on their current level of understanding. <br /><br />
        I would also recommend chatting to your school's IT department
        beforehand to ensure your members can access everything they need to on
        your academy devices or network. This will make your workshop run a lot
        smoother!

      <h2>Configuring your GitHub Organization (optional)</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to make your organization look a bit nicer, here are some
        suggestions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Upload a profile picture</li>
        <li>Add a public email</li>
        <li>Add a short description</li>
        <li>Link to any social profiles you may have</li>
        <li>
          Add a README to your organization
          <ol>
            <li>
              Create a new public repository in your organization called
              '.github'.
              <br />
              <img
                src="https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/0702ed3bcf3ed73fb9825369eb9d1ae7d06961ab_image.png"
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              Add a /profile/README.md to the '.github' repository. The README
              will appear on your organization's profile, visible to anyone.
              <br />

      <h1>Setting up a Website</h1>
      <h2>If your club doesn't already have a website...</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a new repository in your club's organization, starting with the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/new?template_name=branch-template&template_owner=opott"
            class="link"

          />
        </li>
        <li>
          Open up this new repo in your favourite IDE and fill in all the
          placeholders. Make the website fit around your club!
          <ul>
            <li>
              Or, you could assign this task to your members (carry on reading).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to vercel.com and create a new project:
          <ol>
            <li>
              You may need to install Vercel onto your GitHub organization by
              clicking 'Add GitHub Account'
              <br />
              <img

              />
            </li>
            <li>
              Import your new website repository.
              <br />
              <img

              />
            </li>
            <li>
              Give it a name and hit 'Deploy'!
              <br />
              <img
                src="https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/86a26283143f55f1cc5bff69556fb6ea61f530da_image.png"
              />
            </li>
            <li>Your site is now live!</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>If your club already has a website...</h2>
      <p>
        That's great! Maybe take a look at our template and see how you could go
        about implementing the members page?
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, please could you ensure it is deployed, preferably with Vercel or
        another host that allows you to preview the website on each pull
        request.

      <h1>Running a Workshop</h1>
      <p>
        Every member is required to add a personal page to the site, add a link
        to it to the members page and contribute at least one other thing to the
        site.
      </p>
      <h2>Adding Members to your GitHub Organization</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Firstly, start by collecting all of your members GitHub
          usernames/email addresses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Head to your organization's homepage and click on the 'People' tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the 'Invite member' button, individually invite all of your club
          members to the organization.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Make sure all members accept their invitations!</p>
      <h2>Assigning Tasks</h2>
      <p>
        Every member is required to contribute at least one other thing to the
        site. We track these contributions through GitHub Issues. Members can
        either come up with their own contributions and create an issue to track
        them or leaders can create the issues and assign them to members based
        on their skills/members can ask to claim particular issues.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some ideas of tasks you could create:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Filling out the placeholders & adding information to the site</li>
        <li>Adding more features like a blog or a sign up form</li>
        <li>Intentionally introduce bugs and have someone fix them</li>
      </ul>
